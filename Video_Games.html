                <h1>Video Games</h1>
                <h2>Flash Party</h2>
                So there are different types of fighting games, you have the normal ones, and then you have platform fighters.
                    These fighters put you on a floating stage that forces you to try and knock your opponent off the edge into the different blast zones.
                    Smash Bros. is the classic, iconic franchise that started it all. But there are some others that don't see the limelight but are still really fun.
                    One example is Flash Party, a cross platform platform fighter on mobile and steam. The same core mechanics still apply, but they added some sauce.
                    Stickers allow you to upgrade or change a characters certain move, grants more movespeed, and can enhance your stats in general.
                    <h2>Honkai Impact 3rd</h2>
                    Another game I'm into is Honkai Impact 3rd. You follow Kiana Kaslana, a normal teenage girl who becomes a god. Well, I can't say that she's "normal"
                    in this part of the story either. But I would spoil a huge part of the story if I said what she was. Anyway you fight through enemies and engage in an emotional story of pain and loss.
                    If you like a game that has a lot of dialogue and emotions, this is a game for you.
                    <h2> Pokemon Unite</h2>
                    If you haven't heard of Pokemon, then you probably live under a rock. Everyone knows pokemon for their turn based battles with different moves, abilities, and pokemon. But one of the side games fell
                    under the radar, Pokemon Unite. This game is a MOBA with the pokemon as the characters you can play as. Score goals to take down goal posts to progress further and win the game. There are different classes of characters
                    with different traits to fit that specfic playstyle. The normal rounds last 10 minutes, with the exception of quick matches that take 5 minutes. It's a fun game that needs a push to gain new players.
                    <h2>Mario Kart</h2>
                    Another franchise that I have played a lot of. From Wii, 7, and 8 deluxe, I've been a fan for a long time. This racing game is very common with many people knowing it. You race around as Mario characters with some of the games having kart customization(mostly the newer ones).
                    You race in different tracks that have varying layouts and challenges. Some core mechanics are the items that can make or break your race, drifting can give you a little boost when taking turns, and tricking which gives you boosts after ramps. All of these together can make a fun game for beginners and competitive players who've played a lot.
